My wife chopped off the stems of these innocent white roses about two weeks ago. 
She put the dozen of them in her favorite glass vase and filled it up. 
She hasn’t changed the water once, and now it’s murky and growing algae. 
It looks like the Heather Farm pond that turned green that one year. 
Except it’s not green. 
It’s just super dirty looking.
